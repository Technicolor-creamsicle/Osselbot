# Osselbot
A bot that is kinda stupid, but it works surprisingly well
![Node.js CI](https://github.com/Technicolor-creamsicle/Osselbot/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg)

**THIS BOT REQUIRES HEAVY MODIFICATION TO WORK ON OTHER SERVERS!**

Example config.js to be placed in /src

```json
{
"token" : "API KEY",
     "prefix": "?",
     "verbalabuse": [
       "Quotes",
       "to insult.",
       "your members."
     ]
  }
```
